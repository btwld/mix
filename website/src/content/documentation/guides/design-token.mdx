# Design Tokens

## Introduction

Design tokens are the core of any design system. They are the smallest pieces of a design system that define the visual properties of a UI. These properties can include colors, typography, spacing, and more. Design tokens are used to maintain consistency across an application and make it easier to update the design system. As Mix is a solution for styling and is used for building design systems, it also supports design tokens.

## Getting Started

Mix has built-in support for design tokens. The tokens are used to define the visual properties in key-value pairs, where the key is a class that extends `MixToken` and the value is the actual value of the token.

```dart
// 1. declare the token
final $primary = ColorToken('primary'); // ColorToken is a class that extends MixToken<Color>

// 2. define the token value
MixScope(
  colors: {
    $primary: Colors.lightBlue,
  },
  child: ...
);

// 3. Use the token in a style
final style = BoxStyler()
  .color($primary()) // Use the call method to pass the token value to the style
  .size(100, 100);
```

## MixScope

In the same way we use `Theme` and `ThemeData` in Flutter, Mix has `MixScope`. It is a widget that wraps the application and provides the design tokens values to all its child widgets.

```dart {1,5}
MixScope(
  colors: {
    $primary: Colors.blue,
  },
)
```

## Creating a custom token

Mix provides a set of built-in tokens. But you can also create your own tokens to fit your needs. To create a custom token, you need to extend the `MixToken` class. For the next example, we will create a custom token for a `EdgeInsetsGeometry`.

```dart
class EdgeInsetsGeometryToken extends MixToken<EdgeInsetsGeometry> {
  const EdgeInsetsGeometryToken(super.name);

  @override
  EdgeInsetsGeometryRef call() => EdgeInsetsGeometryRef(Prop.token(this));
}
```

The `call` method of your custom token returns an `EdgeInsetsGeometryRef`, which acts as a reference to the token's value. This reference extends type `Prop<EdgeInsetsGeometry>`, making it fully compatible with any Mix API that accepts this type. For example, you can directly use it with the `padding` parameter of `BoxStyler.create(padding: Prop<EdgeInsetsGeometry>)` to apply our custom token.

```dart
final style = BoxStyler()
  .color(Colors.red)
  .size(100, 100)
  .merge(BoxStyler.create(padding: $spacing()));
```
