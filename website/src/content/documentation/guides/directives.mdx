## Directives

Directives in Mix are specialized attributes that define transformations to be applied to widgets during the build process. They are particularly useful for dynamically modifying widget properties based on specific conditions or parameters.

## Example: Text Directives

A prime example is the `TextDirective`, which allows for text case transformations in `StyledText` widgets.

```dart {4}
StyledText(
  'hello world',
  style: TextStyler().uppercase()
)
```

In this example, the text "Hello World" is transformed to "HELLO WORLD" using the `upperCase()` directive.
