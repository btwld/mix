# Checkbox 

Checkboxes allow the user to select one or more items from a set.

Checkboxes can be used to turn an option on or off. If you have multiple 
options appearing in a list, you can preserve space by using checkboxes.

It does not hold state in itself. This means the `checked` state needs to
be handled outside of the widget. The values can be provided and updated
using the `checked` and `onChanged` properties on the `CheckboxX` constructors.

```dart
bool checked = false;

CheckboxX(
  checked: checked,
  onChanged: (v) => setState(() => checked = v),
),
```

It makes use of the `active` variant, that can be used alongside other
variants, such as `hover`, `press` and `disable`, to provide the best effect
to the end-user.

```dart
CheckboxX(
  mix: Mix(
    (hover | active)( // if hovering and active
      borderColor(MaterialTokens.colorScheme.primary), // the color of the border is [MaterialTokens.colorScheme.primary]
    )
  ),
  ...,
),
```
