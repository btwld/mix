# PressableBox

A widget that builds on Flutter's interactivity foundation to provide a pressable area with customizable style and behavior.

It is designed as a flexible and style-friendly alternative to the traditional `InkWell` or `GestureDetector` widgets.

With `PressableBox`, you can apply visual changes when user interactions like pressing or focusing occur, and integrate these seamlessly into your styled components.

## Usage

To use `PressableBox`, simply wrap your widget with it and specify the interaction callbacks you're interested in, along with any styles you wish to apply:

```dart
PressableBox(
style: Style(
  backgroundColor.blue(),
    onPressed(
      backgroundColor.red(),
    ),
    onHover(
      backgroundColor.green(),
    ),
  ),
onPress: () => print('Pressed!'),
child: StyledText('Press Me'),
);
```

In the example above, the `PressableBox` will apply a blue background color to the child `StyledText` by default, and a red background color when the user presses on it (and a green background color when the user hovers over it, if the platform supports it). The `onPress` callback will also be invoked when the user presses on the `PressableBox`.

## Interaction States

`PressableBox` integrates with various context variant utilities that apply styles based on different widget states and gestures. Here are a few of the interaction states and their corresponding styling hooks:

- `onPress`: Styles applied when the widget is being pressed.
- `onLongPress`: Styles applied when the widget is being long-pressed.
- `onDisabled`: Styles applied when the widget is disabled and therefore non-interactive.
- `onEnabled`: Styles applied when the widget is enabled and interactive.
- `onFocus`: Styles applied when the widget gains focus.
- `onHover`: Styles applied when a pointer has hovered over a widget.
