# Mix Theme

`MixTheme` is the base class for theming your application using Design Tokens in _Mix_. It makes use of a `MixThemeData` class, where you'll be able to style your app globally, as well as dynamically change values and colors

## Initialization

In order to style your app, wrap it in a `MixTheme`:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MixTheme(
      data: MixThemeData(
          // the app style will be defined here
          ),
      child: const MaterialApp(
        title: 'Remix',
        home: AppShell(title: 'Remix Home Page'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


## Design Tokens

Tokens allow to define visual properties like colors, text styles, and spacing that can be consistently applied across all your widgets.

The most important difference between defining a design token in Mix vs. a constant is that Mix allows you to define `context` reference values that will be used on build time.

### Context Tokens

Context Tokens are design tokens that are defined at build time. With this, it's possible to do things like:

- dynamically changing the accent color of the app
- define multiple themes for different parts of the app

Context tokens are made of references (`MixToken`), which can be read by `Style` at build time. There are a lot of built-in context tokens already available for usage, from colors to text:

For example, if you want to create a button with the primary color, you can use `backgroundColor($colors.primary)` and to configure the color that will be used, you can use define it in `MixThemeData` class.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MixTheme(
      data: MixThemeData(
        colors: {
          $colors.primary: Colors.red,
        },
      ),
      child: const MaterialApp(
        title: 'Remix',
        home: AppShell(title: 'Remix Home Page'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now every time you use $colors.primary in your app, it will be replaced by the color you defined in `MixThemeData` in this case, red.

### Creating your own design tokens

You can create your own context tokens is just as easy as creating a constant. The only difference is that you need to use a extentions of `MixToken` that represents the type of the token you want to create. 

For example, if you want to create a `MixToken` that represents a color, you can use `ColorToken`:

```dart
const ColorToken customColorToken = ColorToken('custom.color');
```

To give a variable `customColorToken` a value, you need to add it to `MixThemeData` as a key and the color which he represents as a value:

```dart
MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    customColorToken: Colors.red,
  },
)
```

to use it in a widget, you can use it inside `Style` as a color:

```dart
Box(
  style: Style(
    box.height(100),
    box.width(100),
    box.color.of(customColorToken),
  ),
)
```
