# Theming

## Setting Up MixTheme

Before you begin styling your application with various design tokens, the first step is to configure the `MixTheme`. `MixTheme` serves as an ancestor widget that passes down the defined tokens to all its child widgets, ensuring they can access and utilize the same styling information. Setting up MixTheme correctly is key to leveraging the full power of the Mix package for your application's theming needs.

Here's how you can initialize and implement `MixTheme`:

### Wrapping the Root Widget

To apply your theme globally, you'll want to wrap your application's root widget with the `MixTheme` widget. By doing so, the theme data becomes available to all widgets in the app's widget tree, allowing them to use the established design tokens.

Here's a basic example of wrapping a `MaterialApp` with `MixTheme`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MixTheme(
      data: myMixThemeData, // Your predefined MixThemeData
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Mix Themed App',
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Creating MixThemeData

Creating a `MixThemeData` instance is the next crucial step. This object defines your application's design tokens, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more.

```dart
final theme = MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    ColorToken('primary'): Colors.blue,
    ColorToken('secondary'): Colors.green,
  },
  textStyles: {
    TextStyleToken('heading1'): const TextStyle(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,),
    TextStyleToken('bodyText'): const TextStyle(fontSize: 14,),
  },
  space: {
    SpaceToken.xsmall: 4.0,
    SpaceToken.small: 8.0,
    SpaceToken.medium: 16.0,
    SpaceToken.large: 24.0,
    SpaceToken.xlarge: 32.0,
    SpaceToken.xxlarge: 40.0,
  },
  radii: {
    RadiusToken.small: const Radius.circular(4),
    RadiusToken.medium: const Radius.circular(8),
    RadiusToken.large: const Radius.circular(16),
  },
  breakpoints: {
    BreakpointToken.xsmall: const Breakpoint(maxWidth: 599),
    BreakpointToken.small: const Breakpoint(minWidth: 600, maxWidth: 1023,),
    BreakpointToken.medium: const Breakpoint(minWidth: 1024, maxWidth: 1439,),
    BreakpointToken.large:
      const Breakpoint(minWidth: 1440, maxWidth: double.infinity,),
  },
);
```

## Design Tokens

Tokens allow to define visual properties like colors, text styles, and spacing that can be consistently applied across all your widgets.

The most important difference between defining a design token in Mix vs. a constant is that Mix allows you to define `context` reference values that will be used on build time.

### Context Tokens

Context Tokens are design tokens that are defined at build time. With this, it's possible to do things like:

- dynamically changing the accent color of the app
- define multiple themes for different parts of the app

Context tokens are made of references (`MixToken`), which can be read by `Style` at build time. There are a lot of built-in context tokens already available for usage, from colors to text:

For example, if you want to create a button with the primary color, you can use `backgroundColor($colors.primary)` and to configure the color that will be used, you can use define it in `MixThemeData` class.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MixTheme(
      data: MixThemeData(
        colors: {
          $colors.primary: Colors.red,
        },
      ),
      child: const MaterialApp(
        title: 'Remix',
        home: AppShell(title: 'Remix Home Page'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now every time you use $colors.primary in your app, it will be replaced by the color you defined in `MixThemeData` in this case, red.

### Creating your own design tokens

You can create your own context tokens is just as easy as creating a constant. The only difference is that you need to use a extentions of `MixToken` that represents the type of the token you want to create.

For example, if you want to create a `MixToken` that represents a color, you can use `ColorToken`:

```dart
const ColorToken customColorToken = ColorToken('custom.color');
```

To give a variable `customColorToken` a value, you need to add it to `MixThemeData` as a key and the color which he represents as a value:

```dart
MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    customColorToken: Colors.red,
  },
)
```

to use it in a widget, you can use it inside `Style` as a color:

```dart
Box(
  style: Style(
    box.height(100),
    box.width(100),
    box.color.of(customColorToken),
  ),
)
```
