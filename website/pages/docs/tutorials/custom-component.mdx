# Building Custom Design System Component

Mix is a powerful tool, and to make it even more powerful, we can add support for new widgets and increase its functionality for more and more use cases. Therefore, this guide will help you add support for new widgets.

To make this tutorial more practical, we will add support for a widget from `Material`, the TextField. Specifically, we will add support for the `decoration` attribute, which defines most of the visual aspects of the TextField. As a result, we will be able to go from the default TextField, which looks like this:



## 1. Define the Spec

As we are adding support for a new widget and its attributes that you want to customize, we need to define the spec for it. The spec is an object that defines the attributes the widget has and how to handle them. The spec for the `InputDecoration` is:

```dart
class InputDecorationSpec extends Spec<InputDecorationSpec> {
  final InputBorder? border;
  final bool? filled;
  final Color? fillColor;
  final EdgeInsetsGeometry? contentPadding;

  const InputDecorationSpec({
    this.border,
    this.filled,
    this.fillColor,
    this.contentPadding,
  });

  const InputDecorationSpec.empty()
      : border = null,
        filled = null,
        fillColor = null,
        contentPadding = null;

  static InputDecorationSpec of(BuildContext context) {
    final mix = Mix.of(context);
    return mix.attributeOf<InputDecorationSpecAttribute>()?.resolve(mix) ??
        const InputDecorationSpec.empty();
  }

  @override
  InputDecorationSpec lerp(InputDecorationSpec? other, double t) {
    return InputDecorationSpec(
      border: other?.border,
      filled: t < 0.5 ? filled : other?.filled,
      fillColor: Color.lerp(fillColor, other?.fillColor, t),
      contentPadding: EdgeInsetsGeometry.lerp(
        contentPadding,
        other?.contentPadding,
        t,
      ),
    );
  }

  InputDecorationSpec copyWith({
    InputBorder? border,
    bool? filled,
    Color? fillColor,
    EdgeInsetsGeometry? contentPadding,
  }) {
    return InputDecorationSpec(
      border: border ?? this.border,
      filled: filled ?? this.filled,
      fillColor: fillColor ?? this.fillColor,
      contentPadding: contentPadding ?? this.contentPadding,
    );
  }

  @override
  get props => [
        border,
        filled,
        fillColor,
        contentPadding,
      ];
}
```

At first glance, it may seem a bit complex, but it's not. The `InputDecorationSpec` is a class that extends `Spec` and has a constructor that receives the attributes of the `InputDecoration`. For this example, I chose just four attributes: `border`, `filled`, `fillColor`, and `contentPadding`. However, for a real implementation, you should add all the attributes that the `InputDecoration` has.

Looking at the rest of the class, you can see the named constructor `empty`, which returns a default implementation of the `InputDecorationSpec`, the `of` method that receives a `MixData` and returns an `InputDecorationSpec` with the values of the `MixData`. The `lerp` method is used to interpolate between two `InputDecorationSpec` instances.

The Spec is the base for supporting a new widget and its attributes.

## 2. Create the Attribute

The attribute is the class that will be used to handle the `InputDecorationSpec`. The `InputDecorationSpecAttribute` is:

```dart
class InputDecorationSpecAttribute extends SpecAttribute<InputDecorationSpec> {
  final InputBorder? border;
  final bool? filled;
  final ColorDto? fillColor;
  final SpacingDto? contentPadding;

  const InputDecorationSpecAttribute({
    this.border,
    this.filled,
    this.fillColor,
    this.contentPadding,
  });

  @override
  InputDecorationSpec resolve(MixData mix) {
    return InputDecorationSpec(
      border: border,
      filled: filled,
      fillColor: fillColor?.resolve(mix),
      contentPadding: contentPadding?.resolve(mix),
    );
  }

  @override
  InputDecorationSpecAttribute merge(
      covariant InputDecorationSpecAttribute? other) {
    if (other == null) return this;

    return InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
      border: other.border ?? border,
      filled: other.filled ?? filled,
      fillColor: other.fillColor ?? fillColor,
      contentPadding: other.contentPadding ?? contentPadding,
    );
  }

  @override
  get props => [
        border,
        filled,
        fillColor,
        contentPadding,
      ];
}

```

Looking at the properties' definition, you will see some changes in the property types. For example, now `fillColor` is a `ColorDto`, and `contentPadding` is a `SpacingDto`. This is because the Mix uses `Dto` classes to handle more complex types and provide facilities to use them.

The `InputDecorationSpecAttribute` is a class that extends `SpecAttribute` and has a `resolve` method, which is a useful method to transform the `InputDecorationSpec` from the `MixData`. The `merge` method is used to merge two different declarations of the `InputDecorationSpecAttribute`. A good example of this is:

```dart
final style = Style(
    InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
      border: OutlineInputBorder(),
      fillColor: ColorDto(Colors.blue),
      filled: true,
    ),
    InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
      fillColor: ColorDto(Colors.red),
      contentPadding: SpacingDto.only(top: 10),
    ),
)
```

In this case, the `style` will have the `border` and `filled` from the first declaration, and the `fillColor` and `contentPadding` from the second declaration. Be aware that the second declaration of `fillColor` will override the first one, so the final `InputDecorationSpec` will have the `fillColor` as `Colors.red`.

## 3. Build the Custom Widget

The custom widget is the widget that will use the `InputDecorationSpec` to build itself. It's a class that has a `SpecBuilder` in its composition. For this example, the `CustomTextField` is:

```dart
class StyledTextField extends StyledWidget {
  const StyledTextField({
    super.key,
    super.style,
    super.orderOfModifiers = const [],
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SpecBuilder(
      style: style,
      orderOfModifiers: orderOfModifiers,
      builder: (context) {
        final inputDecoration = InputDecorationSpec.of(context);

        return TextField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            border: inputDecoration.border,
            filled: inputDecoration.filled,
            fillColor: inputDecoration.fillColor,
            contentPadding: inputDecoration.contentPadding,
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

The `SpecBuilder` is a class that extends `StyledWidget`. The `build` method uses the `withMix` method to transform the style received from StyledTextField to a `MixData`, it also verifies if there are some inheritable attributes from the parent widgets, but this only happens if the `inherit` property is `true`. With the `MixData` instance in hands, you can use the `InputDecorationSpec.of` method to get the `InputDecorationSpec` from the `MixData`. Now you are able to apply the `InputDecorationSpec` to the `TextField` and return it.

Now you are already ready to use the `StyledTextField` in your app and customize the `InputDecoration` of the `TextField` with Mix.

```dart
final style = Style(
  InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
    border: OutlineInputBorder(
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
                borderSide: BorderSide.none,
            ),
    fillColor: ColorDto(Colors.blueAccent.shade200),
    filled: true,
    contentPadding: SpacingDto.all(24),
  ),
);
```

## 4. Create the Utility

In the last step, we mentioned that you're ready to use the `StyledTextField` in your app, which is true. However, there's an opportunity to enhance its usability further. By creating a utility, you can simplify the process of applying attributes to the `InputDecoration`, making it even more convenient to customize your text fields.

```dart
class InputDecorationUtility<T extends Attribute>
    extends SpecUtility<T, InputDecorationSpecAttribute> {
  InputDecorationUtility(super.builder);

  @override
  T only({
    InputBorder? border,
    bool? filled,
    ColorDto? fillColor,
    SpacingDto? contentPadding,
  }) {
    return builder(
      InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
        border: border,
        filled: filled,
        fillColor: fillColor,
        contentPadding: contentPadding,
      ),
    );
  }

  late final fillColor = ColorUtility((color) => only(fillColor: color));

  late final filled = BoolUtility((boolean) => only(filled: boolean));

  late final contentPadding =
      SpacingUtility((spacing) => only(contentPadding: spacing));

  T border(InputBorder inputBorder) => only(border: inputBorder);
}

```

The `InputDecorationUtility` is a class that extends `SpecUtility` and has methods to create the `InputDecorationSpecAttribute` with the attributes of the `InputDecoration`. The awesome thing about it is that each pre-defined Utility has some facilities to use the attributes. For example, the `filled` returns a `BoolUtility` that comes with `on` and `off` methods to make the code more readable, or the `fillColor` that returns a `ColorUtility` that comes with a bunch of methods to make it easier to use the `Color` attributes and perform operations with them.

To finish, you can create a variable to use the `InputDecorationUtility`, like this:

```dart
final $inputDecoration = InputDecorationUtility(MixUtility.selfBuilder);
```

So you can write the `Style` like this:

```dart
final style = Style(
  $inputDecoration.border(
      OutlineInputBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      borderSide: BorderSide.none,
      ),
  ),
  $inputDecoration.filled.on(),
  $inputDecoration.fillColor.,
  $inputDecoration.contentPadding.all(24),
  $with.scale(2),
);
```
