## Mixable Widgets

`package:mix/mix.dart` defines a set of widget primitives that can use _Mix_ `Attributes` and allow them to be rendered with those `Attributes`.

At first glance it might seem these widgets are doing a lot &mdash; in reality, they are simply wrapping basic _Flutter_ widgets and allowing their visual properties to be defined through a _Mix._

The fundamental widget primitive defined in _Mix_ is a `Box`. A `Box` can contain other widgets and a set of `BoxAttributes` to define it's visual properties.

> An easy misconception would be to think that `Box` is **like** a `Container`, but that would be incorrect: `Box` **is** a `Container`.

That means that this:

```dart
Box(style: Style(height(100)));
```

will become the following:

```dart
Container(height: 100);
```

You can think of `Utilities` as shortcuts to defining visual properties. Thus:

```dart
Box(style: Style(borderRadius(100)));
```

will become the following:

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(100),
  ),
)
```

## Mixable catalog

Built-in mixable widgets that you can use right-away in your app.

### Box

`Box` is, basically, a `Container`. A mixable that will usually be the base widget to create most of your layouts.

```dart
Box(
  style: Style(
    height(100),
    width(300),
    borderRadius(15),
    backgroundColor(Colors.amber),
    alignment(Alignment.center),
    elevation(4)
  ),
),
```

### FlexBox

A flex box is a widget that takes a list of children and displays them according to its `axis`.

```dart
FlexBox(
  style: Style(gap(6.0)),
  axis: Axis.horizontal,
  children: [
    IconMix(icon: Icons.search),
    TextMix('Click to search'),
  ],
)
```

#### HBox and VBox

`HBox` and `VBox` are helper widgets that are, basically, a `FlexBox` under the hood. `axis` is, respectively, `Axis.horizontal` and `Axis.vertical`

```dart
Hbox(
  style: Style(gap(6)),
  children: [
    Image.fromAsset('assets/image.png'),
    VBox(
      children: [
        TextMix('Title', variant: title),
        TextMix("""...description...""", variant: paragraph),
      ],
    ),
  ],
),
```

### IconMix

It's capable of displaying icons and inherit data from parent mixes

```dart
IconMix(
  style: Style(
    iconSize(30),
    iconColor(Colors.grey),
  ),
  icon: Icons.add,
),
```

### Pressable

A `Pressable` is a mixable widget that can provide the following information for its descendants:

- hovering
- pressing
- disabled
- focused

Here's how you can create a text button with it:

```dart
Pressable(
  onPressed: () => debugPrint('my awesome button was pressed'),
  child: Box(
    style: Style(
      // when nothing's happening, bg color is the default grey
      backgroundColor(Colors.grey),
      (hover)(
        // when hovering, bg color is a lighter grey
        backgroundColor(Colors.grey.shade300),
      ),
      (press)(
        // when pressing, bg color is a darker grey
        backgroundColor(Colors.grey.shade600),
      ),
      borderRadius(8),
      padding(10),
      alignment(Alignment.center),
    ),
    child: TextMix(
      'PRESS ME',
      style: Style(
        (disabled)(
          text.style(color: Colors.grey.shade900),
        ),
        text.style(color: Colors.black, fontSize: 18.0),
        bold(),
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```

### TextMix

It's capable of rendering text and inherit data from parent mixes

```dart
TextMix(
  'Mix is AWESOME!'
  style: Style(
    text.style(
      color: Colors.black,
      fontSize: 16.0,
      shadow: Shadow(
        color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.2),
        offset: const Offset(2.0, 2.0),
        blurRadius: 1,
      ),
    ),
    bold(),
  ),
),
```
