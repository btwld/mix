# Mixing

You will compose visual attributes using **Mixes**. This allows you to compose, combine, inherit and override visual attributes. If you come from the web you can think of a Mix as a stylesheet. That allows to group visual attributes.

## Create a Mix

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  The order of the attributes is important, and keep in mind when composing and
  overriding them. Attributes will be prioritized from right to left.
</Callout>

### `Mix()`

You can create a Mix by calling it's class and passing positional attributes like so

```dart

final mix = Mix(
  height(100),
  width(100),
  bgColor(Colors.purple),
  rounded(10),
);

```

### `Mix.fromList()`

Allows you to create a Mix from a List of attributes. This has the same behavior but provides the ability to receive a List instead of positional arguments. 

```dart
final mix = Mix.fromList([
  height(100),
  width(100),
  bgColor(Colors.purple),
  rounded(10),
]);
```

It also provides the possibility to use optional attributes using `if/else`:

```dart
final mix = Mix.fromList([
  if (hasError) 
    bgColor(Colors.red)
  else
    bgColor(Colors.green),
  textColor(Colors.white),
  bold(),
]);
```

## Extend an existing Mix

Mixes are immutable. The new Mix created will inherit all attributes of the original.

### Add attributes

#### `.mix()`

If you have an existing Mix you can add attributes to it by calling the `mix` method. This will return a new Mix with the new attributes added.

```dart
final newMix = mix.mix(
  height(200),
  width(200),
  bgColor(Colors.red),
);
```

#### `.addAttributes()`

Similar to `mix` but allows you to pass a List of attributes.

```dart
final newMix = mix.addAttributes([
  height(200),
  width(200),
  bgColor(Colors.red),
]);
```

### Combining Mixes

Combining Mixes is a critical part of composing visual attributes. There are a few methods, and constructors that allow for easy ways to combine them.

#### `.apply(Mix)` and `.applyMaybe(Mix?)`

```dart
final thirdMix = firstMix.apply(secondMix);
```

If you are receiving a nullable Mix as a parameter there is a simple helper method to keep your code clean: `applyMaybe`

```dart
Mix? secondMix;
final thirdMix = firstMix.applyMaybe(secondMix);
```

#### Mix.combine()

Creates a new Mix from a positional arguments of Mixes.

```dart
final thirdMix = Mix.combine(firstMix, secondMix);
```


## Utility Helpers

### Mix.chooser()

Uses a _Mix_ based on a condition

```dart
final errorMix = Mix(bgColor(Colors.red));
final successMix = Mix(bgColor(Colors.green));

final mix = Mix.chooser(
  condition: hasError,
  ifTrue: errorMix,
  ifFalse: succesMix,
);
```
