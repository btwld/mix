# Decorators

Decorators allow to extend Mix functionality by providing an easy way to define it's Widget composition tree. This allows to keep the a lean core, and give complete control over layout, attribute, and widgets not supported by our `MixableWidgets`.

As an example we will provide the implementation for our `scale` attribute. The Container does not provide a scale property, so the implementation is done by wrapping a `Container` with the `Transform` widget.

```dart
Transform.scale(
  scale: 0.5,
  child: Container(
    child: const Text('Half sized box'),
  ),
)
```

Since `Box` is a `Container` it also does not have a `scale` property. However by using a `Decorator` we can accomlish the same effect.

```dart
Box(mix: Mix(scale(0.5)));
```
