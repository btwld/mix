# Mix — mix_schema Evolution Plan (focused context)

## Mission

Execute the **mix_schema evolution plan** in [`plan/`](plan/README.md): make
`packages/mix_schema` a complete, elegant wire contract for Mix styles — serving preset
packages (`mix_tailwinds`), server-driven styling, and shared design tokens, and composing
under a future widget-tree layer.

Everything derives from the review findings snapshotted in
[`plan/findings.md`](plan/findings.md) — verdict: **keep the skeleton**
(Ack codecs decoding into real Mix stylers, fail-loud encode, canonical forms),
**replace the policies** (tokens, versioning, single-source encode, frozen registry),
and realign the tailwinds consumer.

## How to work the plan (every session)

1. **Orient** — read `plan/README.md` (status board), then `plan/session.md` (latest
   entry), then `plan/lessons.md`, then the active `plan/phaseN.md`. Before coding,
   run a phase-entry agent review of the active phase plan against prior
   decisions/lessons and apply any lesson-driven checklist adjustments.
2. **Decide before doing** — resolve the phase's *Open decisions* (D-items) first and
   record outcomes in its Decision log. Don't start tasks gated on an open decision.
3. **Execute** — work the task checklist in order, checking items off in the doc as they
   land. Requirements carry `[review A1]`-style tags — read the tagged finding in the
   review before implementing.
4. **Verify** — meet the phase's exit criteria; the standard gate is
   `melos run gen:build && melos run ci && melos run analyze`.
   Never check off an item without fresh passing output.
5. **Review before closing** — after the phase appears complete and verified, run a full
   agent/code review over the whole phase diff (implementation, tests, generated files,
   docs, and plan updates). Use `dev-tools:code-review` and delegate to a fresh
   reviewer agent when available. Address findings before marking the phase completed.
6. **Hand off** — append a `plan/session.md` entry (did / decisions / blocked / next) and
   update the README status board. On phase close: fill the phase's *Decision log &
   lessons* and roll cross-cutting insights into `plan/lessons.md`.
7. **Commit** — land exactly one local commit per completed phase. Do not split a phase
   into multiple commits unless Leo explicitly asks; if another rule appears to require
   a split, stop and ask.

Phase order: **0 → 1 → 2 → 2.5 → 3 → 4 → 5**. Phase 2.5 lands the cross-phase
review fixes (`plan/findings.md` Addendum, X1–X12) before token work; phase 2's
inventory run generates phase 4's backlog (`plan/coverage-backlog.md`, regenerated
by 2.5); phase 4's gradient codec gates phase 5's bypass removal; phase 5 starts
with a benchmark before deciding.

## Key references

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Plan, status, session log, lessons | `plan/` |
| Review findings behind the plan (finding IDs `A*`/`B*`/`C*`; prior code-review `S*`/`C*` items reconciled at the bottom; cross-phase review addendum `X*`) | `plan/findings.md` |
| Wire format spec — keep in lockstep with code | `packages/mix_schema/WIRE_CONTRACT.md` |
| Packages in scope | `packages/mix_schema`, `packages/mix_tailwinds`; `packages/mix` for minimal core asks only |

## Environment & commands

- Flutter **3.41.7 via FVM** (`fvm flutter …`), Dart ≥3.11. If flutter is missing: `bash setup.sh`.
- `melos bootstrap` · `melos run gen:build` · `melos run ci` · `melos run analyze` · `melos run fix`

## Critical rules

- `mix.dart` and `*.g.dart` are generated — never hand-edit. `melos run gen:build` after
  spec changes; `melos run exports` for the barrel.
- Specs are immutable; Styler fields are `$`-prefixed `Prop<V>?`.
- Tests assert **behavior**, never requirement IDs (`packages/mix_schema/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  convention — the plan's R-IDs are planning artifacts only).
- `packages/mix` is a **published stable package** (≥2.0.3): core changes must be
  minimal and CHANGELOG'd. This plan uses one commit per phase, so do not split
  core changes into a separate commit unless Leo explicitly asks.
- Conventional Commits `type(scope): description` — scopes: `mix`, `mix_schema`,
  `mix_tailwinds`, `mix_generator`, `mix_annotations`, `mix_lint`.
  Branch: `feat/mix_schema`; PRs target `main`.
