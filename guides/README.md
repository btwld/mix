# Repository Guides

This folder stores repository-specific contributor guides and conventions for Mix.

- Scope: Repo-level guidance for contributors and maintainers
- Audience: Internal to this repository (not package end-user docs)
- Examples: API composition patterns, coding conventions, contributing workflows

If you want these guides mirrored privately, keep the source of truth in Notion and add a link here.
